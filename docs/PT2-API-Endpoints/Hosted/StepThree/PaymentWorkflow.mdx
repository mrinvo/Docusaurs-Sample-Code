# Payment Workflow

<HostedIntro title="" content="" />


In this article, we will wake you through the payment workflow for PayTabs Hosted Payment Page. 

1. The Hosted Payment page uses a Transaction API request which will return a response with a payment page link.

2. The merchant should navigate/redirect the customers to this previous payment page link, which he will have its URL in the response; in order to complete the payment.

3. Once the payment is completed, PayTabs will redirect the customer back to the merchantâ€™s website, to the return URL that the merchant specified in the API request, and the payment results will be posted to that URL.
