# System Requirements 
Since you're using PayTabs API endpoints, most of the logic is handled by the PayTabs since it's the endpoints' provider, so to start integrating our PT2 API endpoints smoothly with your system, the ONLY requirement is to have a [PayTabs]({urls.site}) merchant account relative to your country.
